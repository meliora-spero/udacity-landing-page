# Landing Page

Udacity's second project for the Front End Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Files

The starter code is [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page). 

## Submission

Students needed to submit a multi-section page, with a dynamically updating nav menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. 

To complete the project it was required to modify mainly the ```js/app.js``` file. Minor modifications had to be added to the ```index.html``` and ```css/styles.css``` files.

## Details 

### Interface and Architecture

The project should have a structure like the one shown below. All files shown must be present and the ```app.js``` must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when ```index.html``` is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.

```
css
- styles.css    
index.html
js
- app.js
README.md
```
#### Usability

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

#### Styling

Styling has been added for active states.

#### HTML Structure

There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.

### Landing Page Behavior

#### Navigation

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

#### Section Active State

It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

#### Scroll to Anchor

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section (rather than giving the default jump).

### Documentation

The ```README.md``` file should have non-default text in it that is specific to this project. It doesnâ€™t have to be thorough, but should have some basic information, and use correct markdown.

#### Code Quality & Comments

Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](hhttp://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html). Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.

## Optional  

1. Active state to the navigation items.
2. Collapsible/hideable section (click on heading).
3. Hamburger navigation bar for smaller screens.
